### What is Somnia?

Somnia is the # 1 app for ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) sleep. It uses AI (Artificial Intelligence) to handpick tailored, customizable ASMR sounds to help its users fall asleep. The app has been created by Egil Sandfeld and Alice Jennings, and has won the Danish Sound Startup Pitch Battle 2018. Somnia started off as Ro (Danish for Rest), but rebranded into its current name due to the founders' research on how the latter name, Somnia, would work better also for international markets, but it is also pronounceable with more ease. The app is free to use for 30 minutes a day, after which the user is asked to pay a monthly subscription or a one-time fee.
